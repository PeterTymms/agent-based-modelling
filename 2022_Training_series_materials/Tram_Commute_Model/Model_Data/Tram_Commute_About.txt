## WHAT IS IT?
This model is intended to demonstrate three broad concepts, each of which has an associated NetLogo extension: 
* importing and exporting files into NetLogo via the CSV extension, 
* loading point, line and polygon shapefiles into NetLogo via the GIS extension, and 
* building and navigating networks of agents via the NW extension.
To achieve this, the model creates a cross-local authority tram network along with houses, commuters and places for them to travel to. The modeller can choose to create a randomly generated tram network via a few inputs (number of local authorities, number of tram stops, etc.) or can  load a real-world tram network using downloaded shape files (in this case, the shape files relate to the Greater Manchester combined authority and Metrolink system). 

## HOW IT WORKS
The model operation is broadly similar for both the random and shape file tram networks, although the set up procedures for these two options are very different. In both cases, the NetLogo world is divided into local authorities with names and populations before tram stops are located and linked. Then, houses and destinations (non-house buildings that commuters can travel to) are located in the local authorities. The houses are then peopled with commuters, who identify a small set of destinations across the network and then travel around the network visiting those destinations. 
Both the random and non-random models have the option to export data to a .csv file; whenever a commuter arrives at their destination, they write a line to the .csv file that states their who number, their origin, the local authority of their origin, their destination, the local authority of their destination, and the number of time steps needed to travel between the origin and destination. 
Both the random and non-random models also offer the Tram_Commute_Only? option, which limits the houses and places to only local authorities that have tram stops. 
The random model has input options that can tailor the network that is created, such as the number of local authorities, the number of tram stops, the number of places and the upper limit of possible population per local authority. 
The non-random model draws these details from the shape files and also draws the correct tram stop connections from an imported .csv file. Setting these variables will have no effect if projection is not set to random. 
There are several options to label things, like the LAs and the tram stops, which only affects the display. 
There are also options intended to be useful for testing and demonstration purposes.  Reduce_Population_for_Dispaly? limits the population to a fraction of its total in order to speed up the set up and go processes. Garrulous? runs the model with many outputs written to the command centre. 

## HOW TO USE IT
Put all files in a sensible folder. This is especially important when running the non-random projection as the model will need to access the shape files and/or .csv files. You may need to rename the files, the folders they are in, or the path to the files as it appears in the code. 
When the model is opened, the modeller will need to decide whether to run a random or non-random model. The modeller should set the options for labelling tram stops and/or local authorities, restricting the population for display, restricting the houses and places to LAs with tramstops only, and whether or not an export file should be created (as well as setting the name of that file in the Output_File field). 
Random models will require attention to the inputs at the bottom (Max_Random_Populaton, Number_of_Generated_LAs, Number_of_Generated_Tramstops, Number_of_Generated_Places). 
Hit set up. 
Hit Go once or Go Forever. 

## THINGS TO NOTICE
This model is not particularly realistic. It assumes that all commuters travel directly from their houses to their nearest tram stop, travel by tram to the stop nearest their intended destination, then travel directly to that destination before turning around and repeating the process with a new destination (which might be their house). 
There is no wait time at tram stops. There is no maximum capacity on the trams. There is no distribution of travel speeds among commuters to account for people that might bike, drive, bus, rollerskate or otherwise travel to the tram stop or people that walk slower than others. 
Commuters do not spend any significant time at their destinations. They do not have regular patterns of travel, analogous to a standard commute, but instead randomly pick their destination from among the small set of destinations they have designated as “theirs”. 
This is because this model is not intended to replicated an interesting real-wold behaviour with the detail and specificity needed to really say something about that behaviour. Instead, it is meant to demonstrate the processes of importing files, using GIS data, navigating networks, and running experiments. As such, the code is extremely thoroughly commented. 
## THINGS TO TRY
A couple of things to try would be to:
* run parameter sweeps on the random model to identify whether there are interesting interactions,
* replace the Greater Manchester shapefiles with analogous files for another tram network, or
* rewrite the output file to include reports from place-agents or tramstop-agents to identify which is the most popular.
## EXTENDING THE MODEL
Reasonable interactions would include:
* Adding bus, bike lane, road, train or other networks, 
* Define the destinations that commuters travel to by when they are likely to arrive or how long they spend there, 
* Add options to vary the travel speed, 
* Introduce actual trams to the tram network so that commuters wait at tram stops or when changing tram lines, 
* Other?
